# 👋 Hey, I'm SoyaL

### 🧠 Noob Developer  
> Trying to learn programming so I can reprogram **me**.

---

## 🛠️ What I'm Doing

- Learning web development (HTML, CSS, JS)
- Building small but useful projects
- Exploring how code can shape the world—and me

---

## 🚧 Projects I'm Working On

🔐 [Password Generator](https://github.com/soyalk9/password-generator)  
A simple and responsive website to generate strong passwords for better security.

📦 _More projects coming soon as I keep leveling up!_

---

## 🌱 Goals

- Learn JavaScript deeply
- Get into backend (maybe Node.js or Python)
- Make something weird, useful, or both

---

## 🧩 Fun Facts

- I break stuff a lot. Then I fix it (sometimes).
- Still amazed every time my code runs without errors.
- Not a professional, just passionate (and stubborn).
